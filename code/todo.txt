ASSETS
- rethink the sprite meta as content thing.. it doesn't seem natural
- replace the lru asset eviction scheme
- hot patching for both meta and content
- multithreaded asset loading
- maybe don't keep texture contents in CPU memory after sending them to the GPU
- other asset types
- sprite manager tool
- import tools for all asset types

MEMORY MGMT
- use arenas in the platform layer
- gpa better reuse block matching
- maybe dynamically growing arenas

MATH
- matrices
- simd

RENDERER
- renderer api
